# Undertale Discord Rich Presence
A Rich Presence "Mod" for Undertale. (Working with Save-Games)

The script works with the savegames of UNDERTALE.
So every time you save, the stats will refesh after a period of time (every 10 seconds).

The script catches data like kills, playtime, deaths, LV, Room, Area and so on.
But the Discord Rich Presence shows "only" the Playtime, a picture with text for every area, the room name, the current LV and kill count.

In Discord it looks like this:<br>
